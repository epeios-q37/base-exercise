*NOTA*: You can test this project with nothing to install, only by using a web browser, thanks to [Repl.it](https://q37.info/s/mxmgq3qm). Go [here](https://q37.info/s/srnnb7hj), click on the `+ new repl` button, choose `Python` as language and give the address of this repository in the dedicated field. To launch an exercise, put `from en import *` or `from fr import *` in the `main.py` file, click on the green (`run`) button, and then on the then displayed [QR code](https://q37.info/s/3pktvrj7).

This project is provided to be used as a base to develop your own exercises.

Nowadays, almost all young people have a smartphone, so they are used to graphical interfaces. They rarely, if ever, had to deal with a text console. For them, writing programs with a textual interface may be (falsely) considered outdated and, therefore, not very interesting. This is why modern should provide a web interface, unlike the exercises usually provided with programming tutorials, which almost always have only a text-based interface. 

When the exercise is launched, a web browser will automatically be opened to give access to its interface, which you can see in the above picture.

The application corresponding to the exercise can also be opened on any device connected to the Internet, through the URL opened in the browser. This is facilitated by the [QR code](https://q37.info/s/3pktvrj7) displayed in the web browser, which can be scanned by a smartphone.

`en.py` is the English version of the exercise, and the `fr`, the French one. To adapt the exercises to another language, duplicate the `en.py` or `fr.py` file in the `workshop` folder, and adapt this content to the desired language.
